## Setup

```console
shell:~$ yarn install
shell:~$ yarn build
```

## Close patients: lost to follow-up

Create a completed closure program stage and complete enrollment on patients whose last consultation date is older than the current date minus a time of reference in days and whose enrollment occurred between an optional start date and end date. Those patients also cannot have any closure program stage or enrollment completed.

```console
shell:~$ yarn start patients close --url='http://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:8080' \
  --org-units-ids=bDx6cyWahq4 \
  --start-date=2022-01-01 \
  --end-date=2022-12-31 \
  --tracker-program-id=ORvg6A5ed7z \
  --program-stages-ids=tmsr4EJaSPz \
  --closure-program-id=XuThsezwYbZ \
  --time-of-reference=0 \
  --pairs-de-value=B2djsn1DVCj-1,qbZ8eKRUxYT-2 \
  --comments=SoLScs3kn7E-Comment \
  [--post]
```

To not send the payload and just display it, do not add the `--post` flag.

## Notes

If a program rule gives an error it will appear like on this example:

`11:29:25.192 ERROR POST /tracker: "Generated by program rule ('m8YFYXQOhw4') - Unable to assign value to data element 'g5FsMMsjI55'. The provided value must be empty or match the calculated value '2022-10-04'"`

In this case I saw that closure program stages always include Age at enrollment (added by program rules). If it is added on the command, it will throw the above error if it's not the expected one.
